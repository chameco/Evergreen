A 2D game engine, writen in Python and C++, that follows the Mediator and MVC design patterns.

INTRODUCTION
------------

Since this is fairly complicated, I'm going to write the actual documentation later. Instead,
I have some advice: read client.py before ANYTHING else. It follows the same basic model as the
server, but it's significantly less complex. Then, once you get used to my coding style, move over
to server.py and level.py. Trust me: I've been working on this for almost 6 months, and after a
point it becomes impossible to comprehend it all at once. To help you out, I've included a file
graph.png, inside the trunk/graph folder, that contains a massive graph of all the function calls
going on.
